# HTML/CSS Template for Codeanywhere

This is a simple HTML and CSS template project with a Node.js server for Codeanywhere.

[Try it out](https://app.codeanywhere.com/#https://github.com/Codeanywhere-Templates/html)

## Running the project

The project will automatically start when you open it in Codeanywhere thanks to the DevContainer configuration.

If you need to start it manually, open the terminal and run:

npm install
npm start
```

The server will start on port 3000. You can access it at http://localhost:3000.
